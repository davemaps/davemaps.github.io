## davemaps.com

You’ve stumbled upon the GitHub repository for [davemaps.com](https://davemaps.com/), where I share things (usually GIS/cartography-related) I’ve created or found.

### How it works

The content for the website is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and assets are added to the repository. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) then compiles the site with the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and deploys it to [davemaps.com](https://davemaps.com/).
