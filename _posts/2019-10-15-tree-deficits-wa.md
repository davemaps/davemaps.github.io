For an analysis grad course I used US Forest Service data to calculate tree density and tree “deficits” across Washington. Using ecoregions to compare like areas, I attempted to identify areas with tree densities much lower than the region could support, perhaps prioritizing locations for reforestation projects.

The analysis successfully pinpointed areas cleared by human activity and I produced [45 pages of maps and charts]({{ "/assets/pdf/tree-deficits-wa.pdf" | absolute_url }}), if you care to dive in!
