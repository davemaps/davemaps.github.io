AR Quick Look tracking in the snow? Not so much, unfortunately. This is me testing out an early iteration of an idea to visualize lives lost to Covid with empty chairs. The 140 chairs in this field represent Pennsylvania’s 7-day rolling average of confirmed Covid deaths in recent days. The depth sensing hardware really struggles to track my position relative to the snow-covered ground.

Sorry for all the camera shake, but you can see the AR scene shifting wildly as I trudge through the snow. Besides losing the magic of the augmented reality experience, without stable positioning it’s impossible to accurately scale and place the objects in the first place.
