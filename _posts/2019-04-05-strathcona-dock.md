![Photo of a small mountain-side lake with a single small dock sticking out from the shore.]({{ "/assets/img/photo-strathcona-dock.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Hiking through the mist on the [Forbidden Plateau][1] in Strathcona Provincial Park, British Columbia, we came out of the forest to look over this small lake. Though this landscape may be a dayâ€™s hike from the nearest road, the sole human-made object in the photo, the dock, shifts our view of the lake, forest, and mountain such that we encounter them together as a source of recreation.

Taken with my little Fuji X70 and those beautiful Fuji jpeg colors. (Straight out of the camera plus a little straightening.)
