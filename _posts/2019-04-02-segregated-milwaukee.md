![Three maps of Milwaukee, showing the white and black populations, as well as the three major racial groups together.]({{ "/assets/img/map-milwaukee-segregation-2048.jpg" | absolute\_url }})

A dot density map of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, showing white, black, and Latinx residents in the Bucks’ colors. A [2018 Brookings study][1] showed Milwaukee as having the highest black-white segregation among large American cities.

In a March [interview in The Guardian][2], Bucks’ guard Malcolm Brogdon spoke about his experience of living in such a segregated city. The NBA team has a very public recent history confronting racism.

In 2015, center John Henson [had the police called on him][3] while attempting to buy a watch at a suburban jewelry store. Bucks president Peter Feigin called the city “the most segregated and racist place” a year later, and [the organization has been outspoken][4] in support of its players and in working on issues of racial inequity.

In early 2018, rookie Sterling Brown was apprehended for a parking violation in a Walgreens lot. “Nearly a dozen officers responded and Brown was taken to the ground and tasered in the back.” The Bucks [supported Brown][5] in his filing of a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and its police department.
