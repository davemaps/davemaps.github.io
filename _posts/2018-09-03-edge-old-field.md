An iPhone photo of some trees lining the edge of an old field, taken one dreary winter morning a year-and-a-half ago while hiking in a local county park with my kids. I hope to get back there in more ideal light with another camera, but I post because Iâ€™m also hoping to map this park and its trails.

Many of our local parks have wonderful trails that are poorly mapped, with some lines on a blank white brochure page. With no indicators of trail scenery, terrain, difficulty, or even tree blaze color, it can make choosing a new hike with kids intimidating.
