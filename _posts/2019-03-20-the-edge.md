![Photo of a San Francisco beach, with rocks, a person walking dogs, truck tracks, and waves and a container ship beyond.]({{ "/assets/img/photo-sfo-beach.jpg" | absolute_url }})

At the edge of the landscape, overlooking a San Francisco beach and Seal Rocks next to the [Cliff House](https://cliffhouse.com/), with the ocean stretching beyond the horizon, we feel boundless and bounded at the same time. The ship can come no closer, the person and dogs can go no further, and the truck has had to turn around. The water occupies the same space, yet never stops moving.
