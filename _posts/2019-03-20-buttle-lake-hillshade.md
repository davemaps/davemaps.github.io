![Strathcona Provincial Park’s Buttle Lake Hillshade]({{ "/assets/img/map-buttle-lake-hillshade.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Andy Woodruff’s done some amazing stuff [rendering hillshades entirely in the browser](https://observablehq.com/@awoodruff/diy-hillshade). Mess around with the various parameters and see the results in the embedded map, no Blender needed. Above is Buttle Lake and the Forbidden Plateau, in Vancouver Island’s Strathcona Provincial Park, with a little bit of a purple added to the shadows, yellow in the highlights, and a bit of a darker green in the lower elevations.
