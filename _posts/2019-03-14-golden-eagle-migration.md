![Five Years of Golden Eagle Migration in One Minute]({{ "/assets/vid/golden-eagle-migration.mp4" | absolute_url }})

Five years of golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) migration in one minute!

In early 2008, The [The Center for Conservation Biology](https://ccbbirds.org/) fitted three juvenile eagles who winter in the Mid-Atlantic with GPS trackers. I’m fascinated by the variability in how closely they follow previous years’ paths as they migrate to Maine, Quebec, and New Brunswick for the summers. The animation adds nuance to my comprehension of their movements compared to a single static map.

I manipulated the data and animated the map (ArcMap) with arcpy for a project in Penn State’s GEOG 485 GIS Programming and Software Development course.

Many thanks to CCB for their work and for access to the data from their [Tracking Golden Eagles in Eastern North America](https://ccbbirds.org/what-we-do/research/tracking/tracking-projects/tracking-golden-eagles-eastern-north-america/) project, where you can learn more about the birds.
