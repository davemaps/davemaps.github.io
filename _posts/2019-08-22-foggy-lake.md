A companion photo to [Forbidden Lake][1], this has been my desktop background for a year. Taken during one of the most magical moments I experienced on Vancouver Island last year, this was from a slightly different vantage point along the lake in the Forbidden Plateau area of Strathcona Provincial Park.
