For a project in a graduate cartography course, I was tasked with creating three advertisements for [London Heathrow Airport][1], the second busiest airport in the world for international passengers. As an exercise, we were to visualize flights departing at various times of the day (above), as well as flights by distance and flights to major tourist destinations (below). Another requirement was that we experiment with different projections as was fitting for the particular ad.

I took inspiration from vintage airline ads, and am proud of the “watch face” concept in the first ad above which had to be executed entirely in ArcGIS Pro…
