My wife and I took a 10th anniversary trip (sans kids, thanks Mom & Dad!) to Portland, ME, and while there visited [Eartha, the world’s largest rotating globe](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/10408). Built at Delorme’s (now Garmin) headquarters in Yarmouth, just a few minutes north on I-295 from Portland, the globe is just over 41 feet in diameter and is printed with shaded relief and depth. We watched it for more than a day…but of course to Eartha a day only takes 18 minutes, as that’s how long it takes for one full rotation of the globe.
