Took my son to the American Natural History Museum in New York for his sixth birthday last week, and we spent more than half the ride from Lancaster, PA to Manhattan staring at the [Amtrak National Route Map](https://www.amtrak.com/train-routes), dreaming of places to go and weâ€™d get there. Needless to say, it was a wonderful ride and some great father-son time!
