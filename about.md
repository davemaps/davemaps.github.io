![Me and my son]({{ "/assets/img/photo-me-and-son.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I’ve been a web developer for over ten years and am currently a graduate student in Geographic Information Systems. davemaps.com serves as my online home – a place where I share things I’ve created or found.

I live in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania with my wife and two kids.
