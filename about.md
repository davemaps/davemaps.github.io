I’ve been a web developer for over a decade and am currently a graduate student in Geographic Information Systems. davemaps.com serves as my online home – a place where I share things I’ve created or found.

I live in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania with my wife and two kids.

You can find me <a href="https://micro.blog/davemaps" rel="me">on micro.blog @davemaps</a>, or [on Twitter @davecreates](https://twitter.com/davecreates).
